<p>The name <span style="color: #2b2301;">‘Code crunches’</span> itself says how exited we are in learning new programming languages.</p>

<p>The moment  you say ‘save money’, the first thing that comes in to our mind is the piggy bank. That’s the reason behind choosing this logo.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="color: #2e6c80;">Motivation</h1>
<p>Gone are the days where we read books and replicate that on a paper in the name of exams. Theoretical knowledge alone doesn’t help in building up our career. Of course, practical knowledge is required to step in to the real world and face real challenges. No doubt this course, ‘Introduction to Software-Engineering for Engineers’ is going to be a new learning experience, where we get chance to implement everything that we study.</p>

<li>Firstly, subject of developing an android app sounds really interesting. The real thrill is when someone uses the app that you develop. An exciting feeling it is.</li>    
<li>We get an opportunity to empirically explore our skills and to know the life cycle of a real time project since the process is going to be the same.</li>
<li>Another interesting aspect is the SCRUM and Agile methodology that we are going to follow.  We feel it’s of great importance because, in almost all Multinational firms Scrum and agile methodology is currently in practice. It really helps in managing work and the team members in an efficient way. Also, as a team it helps us to know where we stand in the deliverables from time to time.</li> 
<li>Also, we get an opportunity to learn new technologies that is in high demand and implement them.</li>
<li>Overall, we strongly believe that this exposure is gonna lay us a strong foundation before we step in to the real time projects.</li>

<p>We are in a world where Money is literally everything so it is really important to track your income which in turn will help you to know how much you can afford to spend and save. People do track the income and expenses but in a tedious way on a sheet of paper or a note. It’s not always easy to maintain a record to track your income and expenses. For instance, how feasible is it to get the details of the expenses that was spent a year ago. This very thought inspired us to digitalise the way we track income and expenditure by developing a Money tracking app. This in turn will make our lives easier by tracking all the transactions in just one click which we believe is a necessity in this current world of technologies.</p>

<h3>Introducing the team code crunchers. </h3>
<ul>
<li>Anusha being a scrum master will see to that the process is being followed and will get the status and updates on a regular basis.</li>  
<li>Jagriti being a developer, will be responsible for designing, developing and testing as well.</li>
<li>Ram Kishore being a developer, will be responsible for designing, developing and testing as well.</li>
<li>Vinoth being the product owner, will be responsible for  grinding the requirements in to number of sprints based on the priority which the team will then take up and start working on. </li>
Though each has some roles, as a team each of us will be involved in all the phases of product development. No doubt, work will be shared equally among the team members.
<p>Before we start with the development, we have decided to go through tutorials to understand the basic concepts of app development and a team meeting will then be organised to have a knowledge transition and to know the team’s strength and weakness.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the status about the progress of each phase will be updated in the WhatsApp group on a daily basis and each sprints will be delivered at the end of every week. Also, we have decided to meetup twice in a week to discuss everything about the product development and to share the knowledge acquired from time to time just to make sure that everyone should know everything about what we are doing as a whole. In case of any discrepancy, any of the team members will have a sole right to call up for a meeting where all the issues will be discussed and addressed.</p>
<p>We will be following the iterative approach to develop the Money tracker app. Below are its phases,</p>
<p>Any change in requirement will also follow the above sequential process. </p>
<p>There might be a situation where any of team members will not be able to participate in some task due to an emergency. In such cases being an effective team no way we are gonna miss the deadline, the rest of the team members will compensate by equally sharing the task that lagged behind. </p>

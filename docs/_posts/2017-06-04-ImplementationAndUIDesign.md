<h2 style="color: #000000; text-align:center;">Welcome to our third Blog, you will see information about the coding conventions followed, whom this application is meant for and prototype of the MoneyTracker application</h2>
</div>
<div>
<h1 style="color: #2e6c80; text-align:center;">Coding Conventions</h1>
<p> A coding standards document tells developers how they must write their code. Instead of each developer coding in their own preferred style, they will write all code to the standards outlined by the organisation or team. This makes sure that a large project is coded in a consistent style and parts are not written differently by different programmers. Not only does this solution make the code easier to understand, but also ensures that any developer who looks at the code will know what to expect throughout the entire application.</p>
<p>Following are the coding conventions that we will be following: </p>
<div>
<ol>
<li><p>The initial package name representing the domain name must be in lower case. For example, de.ovgu.janardhanast.name.login</p></li>
<li><p>Classes are always noun and starts with Uppercase letter followed by lowercase </p></li>
<li><p>Variables always starts with lowercase letter and has mixed case,i.e. it follows camel case convention. Example - Button btnLogin; </p></li>
<li><p>The variables used to store UI components values satrts with the components followed by noun. Example EditText component used to enter UserName will be named as - EditText etUserName;  Radio button that holds income value is named as - RadioButton radiobtnIncome;</p></li>
<li> <p>Functions are always verb and named in accordance to what they do, and are written in lowercase </p></li>
<li><p>Every method and class will hold comments so as to what it does, hence allowing user to quickly understand the functionality</p></li>
<li><p>Constants are always written in Uppercase with underscore seperating the words. Example - int NUMBER_OF_CATEGORY=5;</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Question is how do we make sure that all code adeheres to the coding conventions?</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li><p>Coding standards are defined by discussing with the team, with all the good practices each one is aware of and it has been documented and shared, such that each developer follows the standard </p></li>
<li><p>Once coding is done and tested, code is reviewed by any one of the peer and it is guaranteed if coding conventions are followed and quality of code is maintained </p></li>
<li><p>Comment will be added to the relating issue during code review phase, if the developer fails to meet any standard criterias defined</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">To whom is our MoneyTracker Application more suitable?</h2>
<p>Money Tracker is general purpose application suitable for every individual who is concerned to maintain or track the expenditure, none the less certain pre-requisites are, one willing to use the application has to be aware about usage of mobile phones, installation of android applications. This application can be better utilized by the pupils with age > 8 years, since it involves mathematically calculated results and representation of expenditure and savings interms of graph and Pie charts. This application is only focused for individuals who wish to track their day today expenses, not for group of peoples or doesn't target large scale industrail expenditure maintainance </p>
<p>So considering the above factors we can define the two personas whom the application is more suitable is as follows: </p>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Persona</th>
<td colspan="8"> Student (Living away from home/ in hostels)</td>
</tr>

</table>
</div>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Add category :<span style="color: #000000;"> -Estimate (4 days/25-05-2017 to 28-05-2017)</span></h2>
<p>Categories are further divided in to two sub categories,</p>
